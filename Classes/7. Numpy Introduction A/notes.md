One of the most important and oldest library in python
Numpy is a numeric computing library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
    Only deals with numbers
Have a limited scope
In python processing numbers is very slow when processing large data
    hence Numpy is a very efficient numeric processing library that sits on top of python providing high peformance computation.
It is extremly simple yet powerful
you don't use Numpy directly but libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib that use Numpy under the hood
