.loc method can perform a quick filtering /zoom in into you data

in the second lecture document we are going to use a Sakila Database where instead of reading data from a CSV file to a database
you load te data into you notebook by constructing a query for pulling data from the database to the jupyter notebook then afterwards the processis the same 

## Question

What does the loc method allow you to do?
    - Retrieve a subset of rows and columns by supplying integer-location arguments.
    - Access a group of rows and columns by supplying label(s) arguments.(Correct!)
    - Returns the first n rows based on the integer argument supplied.
