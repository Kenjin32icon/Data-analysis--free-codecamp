We are going to use google notebooks for tis course and.
Google notebook contain cells which are used to write code form programming languages like python, R and human text in form of markdown text
difference between jupyter notebook ad jupyter lab is that jupyter lab is a nicer interface on top of jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook is a free open source notebook
why use jupyter notebook coz it is an interactive real time tool to explore data and perform data analysis you can fire commands and respond directly 
we are not directly looking at the data like in tableau, excel and not scalable for large scale data 
jupyter notebook provides a refernce of the data making it you as commanda asking questions with a view of how the data looks like

 ** Question**
 What is not allowed in a Jupyter Notebook's cell?
    - Markdown
    - Python code
    - An Excel sheet(is not allowed)
